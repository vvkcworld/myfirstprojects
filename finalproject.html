<br>

Description (200 words  giving the person listening to your work insight into your creative and technical process. For example: What was the artistic inspiration for this project? How did you make it your own? What format did you choose to make it in (music video, animation short, pseudo documentary)? What is your video about? What media techniques did you use? How did it change from your Storyboard conception to finish?

I’d say the inspiration for this project was the emotions I used to feel at some point in my life. Even though the character didn’t represent me as a person, the emotions and the sense of living it had were the things I could relate. The format I decided to use was the animated short and I first bought the materials that could be used for Stop Motion before going through it step by step. Then, I used adobe photoshop in order to draw and fit in the objects I couldn’t do in reality. The video was about the barbie doll character which was in the room; a metaphor for the dark, lonely world. She was used to it and at the same time she knew there was no meaning to it, but was still afraid to step out, for a change. Just then a light appeared in her dark world magically. The light is fragile, unstable even, able to extinguish with the slightest touch. Knowing that it was “a change”, she wanted to reach out to it but hesitated since she was scared, scared for a change, scared that it would disappear and when it does, she would be back to her old ways, alone, detached and drown in sorrow, knowing that at that time, the loneliness and the misery would be worse. She was afraid that she wouldn’t be able to hold on anymore at that time since it was better not to lose anything at all in the first place. It was best not to touch anything that could help her escape from her own darkness, while at the same time completely crumble her in a minute. So, she pondered whether to take the risk or not. Eventually, she tried to search for her redemption. I used YouTube tutorials to help me with something I wasn’t skilled at doing. My storyboard consisted of the materials I had the intention to use and it helped me go through smoothly with the plot idea.</p>
